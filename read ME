This stage is the latest stage before the fully-looped heart tube and the data is deriven from the Kaufmann 13 stage. 

There are again two layers and we can derive two types of information from this data points. 
First one is about the location of the data point itself and the second one is the component they belong to. 

It should be mentioned that from this stage heart components are partly recognizable 

================

The number of data point for inner surface is 598 

The number of data point for outer surface is 935 

===============

The mesh structure would be the same and we are interested to create the Mesh with hand here...
